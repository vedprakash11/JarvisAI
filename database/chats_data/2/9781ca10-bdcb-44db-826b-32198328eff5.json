It involves training algorithms on datasets to create models that can make predictions, classify information, or generate content based on patterns learned from the data. This process allows ML models to become more intelligent and capable over time as they receive new data and information.\n\nThere are various types of ML, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each with its unique approach to model training and application."

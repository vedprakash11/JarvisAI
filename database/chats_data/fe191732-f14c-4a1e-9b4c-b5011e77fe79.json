Based on the search results, I didn't find anything specifically about an \"unpopular\" thing about Kanpur, but I did come across some interesting facts.\n\nOne thing that might be considered a lesser-known fact about Kanpur is that it has a significant number of textile factories, earning it the nickname \"The Manchester of East.\" However, this also means that the city has a history of environmental pollution, particularly with regards to air and water pollution.\n\nIf I had to dig a bit deeper, I found a mention of the Bithoor city of Kanpur district. It's known for being the site of the ancient temple of Lord Brahma, one of the most sacred places for Hindus. However, it is also associated with the history of the infamous Chandra Sena, who ruled Kanpur after the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. His rule is considered to be one of the darker periods in the city's history.\n\nWould you like to know more about Kanpur or is there something else I can help you with, Ved?"
